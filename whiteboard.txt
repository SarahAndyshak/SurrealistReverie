Sureralist Reverie

Create an application that stores our memories so we don't have to store them ourselves anymore! Implementation is up to you — it could be a surreal exploration of dreams and the subconscious — or it could be a more practical collection of technical information you've learned and want to store in flashcard form.

Try adding the following:

Full CRUD functionality with hooks and Firestore.
User authentication and basic authorization.
Routing with react-router.
Ability to associate memories with specific users.

    DreamList
      /home/memories/memoryID
      DreamDetail)
    not logged in:
    "you're not logged in!"

Sign in and sign out toggles slightly odd
